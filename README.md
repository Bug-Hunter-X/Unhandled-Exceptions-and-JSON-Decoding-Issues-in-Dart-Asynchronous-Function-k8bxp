# Dart Asynchronous Operation Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous operations:  inadequate error handling and implicit JSON response assumptions.
The `fetchData` function attempts to fetch data from an API.  The primary issues are:
1. **Missing JSON response validation:** It assumes the API always returns valid JSON.  If the server returns an error (e.g., 500) or a non-JSON format, `jsonDecode` will throw an exception, which is generally caught with `catch (e)`. However, this approach provides no information about the type or nature of the error.
2. **Generic exception handling:** The `catch (e)` block is too broad.  It captures all exceptions, making debugging difficult.  Specific exception types should be caught and handled appropriately. 

## Solution
The solution improves error handling by:
* Checking `response.statusCode` before decoding the JSON.
* Using more specific exception handling for network or JSON errors.
* Providing informative error messages.
